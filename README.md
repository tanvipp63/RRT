# RRT Research Assignment 2024  
**Created by Tanvi Parulekar (2024)**

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a robot path planning system based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).  
The main script is `robotFollowingRRT.py`, which integrates tree building, path tracing, and robot simulation.

## Components

### RRT Abstract Data Type (ADT)
Implements core functionalities of the RRT algorithm:
- Tree initialization
- Random sampling
- Nearest node search
- Obstacle checking
- Path tracing from goal to start

### Path Plotting
- Function to visualize the traced path on the map.

### Robot Simulation
- `Robot` class simulates a robot of dimensions **10m × 15m**.
- Follows the path generated by the RRT algorithm.

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Basic RRT**
- **RRT-Connect** – based on the work of *J. Kuffner*
- **Greedy RRT** – based on *Yingrui Xie et al.*

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time** – measured using a time decorator.
- **Path Distance** – computed during path tracing.
- **Number of Sampled Nodes** – recorded during algorithm execution.

## Testing & Evaluation

Test results are saved in individual folders.

### Test Maps
The three algorithms were tested on four maps derived from another research paper:
- `simple`
- `complex`
- `indoors`
- `narrow passages`

## Preprocessing: `readImage.py`
- Prepares the configuration space (c-space) images for path planning.
- Applies a **LINEAR filter**.
- Converts each image into an **occupancy grid** usable by `robotFollowingRRT.py`.
